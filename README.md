Please see the live site here:
[Jill's Recipes](https://recipes.succinct.co.za/)


The recipes (one file per recipe) are in these directories:
* [_baking](/_baking)
* [_savoury](_savoury)

To write a new recipe:

1. Start with (copy) the recipe [template](/template.md) (click Raw for the text you can edit in Notepad.)
2. Write. Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) syntax (like WhatsApp formatting, but richer).
3. Commit.


Feel free to contribute with merge requests.
