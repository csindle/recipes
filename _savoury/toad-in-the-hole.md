## Ingredients & Method

Brown the sausages in a frying pan.

Meanwhile mix up the same batter as for Yorkshire puddings:

400 ml flour, salt, pepper in Magimix.
Then pour in 250 ml water + 250 ml milk + 2 eggs.
Beat till smooth.

Let it rest a while so oven can heat to 400 - very hot !

Grease baking dish, put in sausages. Stir batter, and pour in.

Cook till done and puffed and brown.
